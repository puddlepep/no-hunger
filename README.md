# No Hunger

A Minecraft Fabric mod for 1.18.2 which alters some mechanics to make the game more similar to the pre-hunger days.

**Features**
* Hunger is gone, replaced with a stamina bar to make sure you can't just sprint all over the place constantly.
* Food now just restores health.
* Food stack sizes have been greatly reduced, forcing you to decide how much inventory space you'd like to sacrifice for peace of mind.
